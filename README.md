# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Analysis-and-Recommendation-System
Comprehensive analysis of the Netflix movies and TV shows dataset from Kaggle, done for an internship at CSU Fullerton. Developed a recommendation system using cosine similarity and content-based filtering, achieving high accuracy. Project includes data cleaning, EDA, and detailed visualizations.

This project is a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix movies and TV shows dataset from Kaggle, undertaken for an internship at California State University, Fullerton. The primary objectives of this project were to explore the dataset, uncover meaningful insights, and develop a recommendation system.

Project Highlights:
Data Analysis: Conducted an in-depth analysis of the Netflix dataset, which includes information about movies and TV shows available on the platform. The analysis covers various aspects such as content distribution, genre popularity, release trends, and more.

Visualization: Created detailed visualizations to present the findings, making it easier to understand the data patterns and trends.

Recommendation System: Developed a recommendation system to suggest TV shows or movies to users. This system utilizes the cosine similarity algorithm and content-based filtering to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Performed thorough data cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability of the analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to extract valuable insights and trends from the dataset.

Cosine Similarity Algorithm: Implemented the cosine similarity algorithm to measure the similarity between different content items and provide relevant recommendations.

Content-Based Filtering: Utilized content-based filtering techniques to enhance the recommendation system by considering the features of the content items.

This project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and recommendation systems, and reflects my passion for leveraging data to drive meaningful insights and solutions. The code and detailed documentation are available in this repository.
